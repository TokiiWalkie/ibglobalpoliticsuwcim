# Realism

**Definition –** Realism views states as the key actors in the international system and assumes that states are primarily motivated by self-interest and the pursuit of power

**Classical realism –**

- Key thinkers: Machiavelli, Hobbes
- Focus on power, human nature, and national interest
- States are the primary actors in IR, and they pursue their interests through power and force
- International politics is a struggle for power, and war is a natural consequence of the competition for power
- International law and institutions are important, but only to the extent that they serve the interests of the powerful states

**Structural realism/neorealism –**

- Key thinker: Kenneth Waltz
- Focus on the structure of the international system
- States are driven by a desire for security, and this leads them to engage in power balancing behaviour
- International anarchy is the most important feature of the international system, as it creates a situation where there is no higher authority to enforce agreements
- The distribution of power among states is the main determinant of state behaviour

**5 Key assumptions of structural realism –**

1. States operate in an anarchic global system
2. All states possess some offensive military capability
3. States can never know the intentions of other states
4. The main goal of states is survival
5. States are rational actors

**Defensive structural realism –**

- Key thinker: Kenneth Waltz
- Focus on the importance of security in international politics
- States seek to maximize their security, but they do not necessarily seek to dominate other states
- Balance of power is a key mechanism for maintaining stability in the international system
- War is seen as a failure of diplomacy, rather than a natural consequence of international competition

**Offensive structural realism –**

- Key thinker: John Mearsheimer
- Focus on the pursuit of power and hegemony in international politics
- States seek to maximize their power relative to other states, as this is seen as the best way to ensure their security
- The international system is a constant struggle for power, and war is a natural consequence of this competition
- States are rational actors who are driven by the desire for power and security

**Hegemony in offensive realism –**

- Offensive realists argue that states should always be looking for opportunities to gain more power and should do so whenever it seems feasible
- States should maximise power, and their ultimate goal should be hegemony, because that is the best way to guarantee survival

**Hegemony in defensive realism –**

- While defensive realists recognise that the international system creates strong incentives to gain additional increments of power, they maintain that it is strategically foolish to pursue hegemony.
- States should not maximise power, but should instead strive for what Kenneth Waltz calls an "appropriate ammount of power"

**What do offensive and defensive realism have in common?**

- Both offensive and defensove realists agree, however, that nuclear weapons have little utility for offensive purposes, except where only one side in a conflict has them.
- The reason is simple : if both sides have a survivable reliatory capability, neither gains an advantage from striking first
- Moreover, both camps agree that conventional war between nuclear-armed states is possible but not likely, because of the danger of escalation to the nuclear level.

### Key assumptions of structural realism
#### 1. States operate in an anarchic global system

- Anarchy is an ordering principle
- There is no central authority that stands above states in the system
- The opposite of anarchy is hierarchy which is the ordering principle of domestic politics

#### 2. All states possess some offensive military capacity

- Each state has the power to inflict harm upon its neighbours
- Capacity varies massively between states

#### 3. States can never know the intentions of other states

- States ultimately want to know whether other states are determined to use force to alter the balance of power (revisionists states), or whether they are satisfied enough with it that they have no interests in using force to change it (status quo states)
- It is almost impossible to discern another state's intentions with a high degree of certainity
- Unlike military capacities, intentions cannot be empirically verified. Intentions are in the minds of decision-makers

#### 4. The primary goal of all states is survival

- States also have other goals - e.g. prosperity, protecting human rights
- Survival is primary goal - if a state does not survive it will not achieve any of its goals

#### 5. States are national actors

- States are capable of coming up with sound strategies that maximise  their prospect for survival.
- They are miscalculated from time to time. Because states operate with imperfect information in a complicated world, they sometimes make serious mistakes.

### Why states should show restraint

- Defensive realists emphasise that if any state becomes too powerful, balancing will occur (ex: coalitions)
	- Ex : Napoleonic France, Imperial Germany, Nazi Germany
	- Ex : Otto von Bismarck (for defensive realists) understood that too much power was bad for Germany. Thus, he halted German expansion after the victories (Austro-Prussian war, Franco-Prussian war).
- There is an offence-defence balance which indicates how easy or difficult it is to conquer territory or defeat a defender in battle
	- The offence-ballance is usually heavily weighted in the defender's favour
	- Any states that attemps to gain large ammount of additional power is likely to end up fighting a series of losing wars
	- Accordingly, states will recognise the futility of offence and concentrate instead on maintaining their position in the balance of power. If they go on the offensive, their aims will be limited.
- Even when conquest is feasible, it does not pay ; the cost outweigh the benefits
	- Because of nationalism, it is especially difficult, sometimes impossible, for the conqueror to subdue the conquered
	- The ideology of nationalism is all about self-determination, which virtually guarantees that occupied populations will rise up against the occupier

→ Conquest is not only difficult but, when it is successful, leads to many difficulties and few benefits.

**How do Offensive realists respond ?**

- Claim balancing is often inefficient, especially when it comes to forming balancing coalitions, and that this inefficiency provides opportunities for a clever aggressor to take advantage of its adversaries.  
- Take issue with the claim that the defender has a significant advantage over the attacker, and thus offence hardly ever pays.  
- Acknowledge that sometimes conquest does not pay but they also point out that sometimes it does.
