# Relativism

**Definition â€“** In the context of global politics, the ethical theory of relativism suggests values to be culturally and individually determined. In a relativist view, global agreements on the most fundamental aspects of human life are hence difficult to achieve

- If we define cultural relativism as 'the idea that a person's beliefs, values, and practices should be understood based on that person's own culture, rather than be judged against the criteria of another' then it raises some interesting questions for us as students of Global Politics, particularly in terms of the tension between Universalism and Relativism when it comes to making moral judgments, especially in the field of human rights
- For example, are the universal values promoted in documents such as the UDHR really universal? Or, are they simply Western values masquerading as universal thanks to the privileged and powerful position occupied by the West in the global system?
- To give a specific example, female genital mutilation (FGM) is, when seen in the light of documents such as the UDHR, a violation of human rights that cannot be justified in any case. But who gets to make this value judgment and what right do they have to make such an ethnocentric claim?
- CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTARY DECLARATIONS TO THE UDHR SUCH AS THE CAIRO DECLARATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN ISLAM (1990) AND THE BANGKOK DECLARATION (1993) PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF DEFINING UNIVERSAL STANDARDS, IN THIS CASE RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS.
- Essentially, a relativist theoretical perspective forces us to at least consider the possibility that there are not - and can never be - universal agreement as to what constitutes good or bad, right or wrong
