## Case study – The Rise of China

**Realist Perspective –**

- China’s rise is viewed as a threat to the current global power structure, particularly to the United States’ dominant position
- Realists argue that China’s increasing military and economic power will lead to a security dilemma, as other states in the region will see China as a threat and seek to balance against it
- Realists believe that the balance of power will shift towards China, and that this shift will lead to conflict with the United States and other regional powers

**Liberal Perspective –**

- China’s rise is viewed as an opportunity for increased global cooperation and economic growth
- Liberals argue that China’s integration into global institutions, such as the World Trade Organization, will lead to greater economic interdependence and therefore greater peace
- Liberals believe that China will adopt more democratic and liberal values as it becomes more integrated into the global system, and that this will lead to a more peaceful and cooperative world order

**Links to concepts –**

- **Power transition theory –** China's increasing economic and military power is challenging the dominance of the United States and other Western powers, leading to a potential power transition in the international system
- **Hegemonic stability theory** – Some scholars argue that the current international system is based on a Western-dominated liberal order, and China's rise may lead to a shift away from this order. This could lead to instability and conflict, unless China can provide an alternative framework for international cooperation and governance
- **Soft power** – China has also been using soft power to expand its influence, through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and cultural diplomacy programs. This has the potential to shape global norms and values in a way that supports China's interests
- **International institutions** – China's rise has also led to debates about the role of international institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the United Nations. China's growing economic and political influence may enable it to reshape these institutions to better align with its interests.
