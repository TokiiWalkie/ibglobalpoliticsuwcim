# Constructivism

**Definition –** Constructivism accounts for this issue by arguing that the social world is of our making. Actors (usually powerful ones, like leaders and influential citizens) continually shape – and sometimes reshape – the very nature of international relations through their actions and interactions.

**Definition –** Social constructivism argues that meaningful actions and behavior are plausible only within an inter-subjective context, which is sustained by a set of norms and corollary social practices- a ‘structure’-, and discourse- ideas, knowledge, language, culture and ideology- makes this structure possible

Constructivism gained in importance at the end of the Cold War and the fall of the USSR, which neither classic theories such as realism or liberalism could account for. By having a dominant focus on the state, traditional theories have not opened much space to observe the agency of individuals. After all, it was the actions of ordinary people that ensured the end of the Cold War, not those of states or international organisations

## The basics of constructivism

- Constructivism sees the world as socially constructed
	- Constructivists go beyond the material reality by including the effect of ideas and beliefs on world politics
	- Entails that reality is always under construction, which opens prospects for change
	- Meanings are not fixed but can change over time depending on the ideas and beliefs that actors hold
- Agency and structure are mutually constituted, which implies that structures influence agency and that agency influences structures
	- Agency can be understood as the ability of someone to act
	- Structure refers to the international system that consists of material and ideational elements
- States can have multiple identities that are socially constructed through interaction with other actors
	- Identities are representations of an actor’s understanding of who they are, which in turn signals their interests
	- **Example –** Interests of a large stats vs interests of a small state
		- The identity of a small state implies a set of interests that are different from those implied by the identity of a large state. 
		- The small state is arguably more focused on its survival, whereas the large state is concerned with dominating global political, economic and military affairs
	- The actions of a state should be aligned with its identity. A state cannot act contrary to its identity because this will call into question the validity of the identity
	- **Example –** Germany at the end of WWII
		- Germany, despite being a great power with a leading global economy, did not become a military power in the second half of the twentieth century. 
		- Following the atrocities of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime during the Second World War, German political identity shifted from one of militarism to pacifism due to unique historical circumstances
- States that conform to a certain identity are expected to comply with the social norms that are associated with that identity
	- Comes with an expectation that some kinds of behaviour and action are more acceptable than others → actors behave in certain ways because they believe that this behaviour is appropriate
	- Three types of norms – 
		- Regulative norms – order and constrain behaviour
		- Constitutive norms – create new actors, interests or categories of action
		- Prescriptive norms – prescribe certain norms, meaning there are no bad norms from the perspective of those who promote them
	- Norms undergo the lifecycle of norms before getting accepted

**Example –** British and North Korean nuclear weapons

- 500 British nuclear weapons are less threatening to the United States than five North Korean nuclear weapons. 
- These identifications are not caused by the nuclear weapons (the _material structure_) but rather by the meaning given to the material structure (the _ideational structure_). 
- It is important to understand that the social relationship between the United States and Britain and the United States and North Korea is perceived in a similar way by these states, as this shared understanding (or intersubjectivity) forms the basis of their interactions. 
- The example also shows that nuclear weapons by themselves do not have any meaning unless we understand the social context
- The social relation of enmity between the United States and North Korea represents the intersubjective structure (that is, the shared ideas and beliefs among both states), whereas the United States and North Korea are the actors who have the capacity (that is, agency) to change or reinforce the existing structure or social relationship of enmity. 
- This change or reinforcement ultimately depends on the beliefs and ideas held by both states. If these beliefs and ideas change, the social relationship can change to one of friendship
