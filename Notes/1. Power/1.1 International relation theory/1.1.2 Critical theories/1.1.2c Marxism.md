# Marxism

**Definition –** Marxist concepts are all connected by the common goal to contribute to what they perceive as the greater good of humankind and its environment

**Main assumptions of Marxism –** The capitalist mode of production and the modern sovereign states system are not natural or inevitable events. They are interdependent products of particular historical conditions and social relations

## Historical materialism

**Definition –** The philosophy underpinning Marxist social, political, and economic analysis. Marx and Engels developed historical materialism in opposition to the ‘idealism’ of German philosophy at the time. It emphasizes that the material social conditions we live in – especially our mode of production shape our intellectual, political, and cultural life, whereas idealists (e.g. Hegel) tended to see it the other way around.

- Main theory of development of capitalism
- Human beings are determined by the material conditions in which they can survive and reproduce
- **Marxism asserts that material conditions can be changed by the actions of human beings as well as by events**
- Marxism fundamentally questions what ‘the international’ is in IR. Whether it is anarchy for realists or international society for the English school, Marxists argue that such concepts are problematic because they make us believe in illusions or myths about the world.
	- **Example –** the concept of anarchy creates the mirage that states are autonomous agents whose rational behaviour can be predicted. However, this ignores the endurance of regional inequalities and the structural and historical links between states, violence and the key actors of the global political economy

## World Systems Theory

- Main thinker: Immanuel Wallerstein
- Similar to 'dependency theory of development'
- Distinguished three groups of states or regions: the core, the semi-periphery and the periphery
	- The core group of states (e.g. in Western Europe and North America) refers to democratic governments providing high wages and encouraging high levels of investment and welfare services. 
	- The semi- periphery states (e.g. in Latin America) are authoritarian governments that provide low wages and poor welfare services for their citizens. 
	- Periphery states (e.g. sub-Saharan and Central Africa, South Asia) refer to non- democratic governments where workers can mostly expect wages below subsistence levels and where there are no welfare services
- The core is able to produce high-profit consumption goods for itself as well as for the semi-periphery and periphery markets because the periphery provides the cheap labour and raw materials to the core and semi-periphery necessary to make these high-profit consumption goods
- The capitalist core always needs a peripheral region that provides the means for the core to sustain a high level of consumption and security
- Argues that dependency and inequality are essential for the functioning of capitalism and cannot be significantly reduces 

## Western Marxism

- Main thinker: Antonio Gramsci
- Argues that the domination of some groups  of individuals (or groups of states) over other groups also depends on ideological factors
- Argues that the relations of dependency and types of groups (or units) used to understand those relations are more varied and fluid than world systems theory
	- Culture and cultural institutions – schools, churches, newspapers, literature, music, film, television – are not mere epiphenomena of the economic base but rather play an absolutely central role in its reproduction. In other words, for Western Marxism, without capitalist ideological cultural production – from schools and churches to TV shows and video games – to convince people of the naturalness and goodness of capitalism, there could be no capitalist economy.
