# 1.2 Nature of power

**Definition –** Power is the ability to influence the behaviour of other actors in global politics and achieve the desired outcomes. 

In what way can we influence other actors behaviours ? The different types of power :

- Military, economic
- Hard, soft, smart
- Unilateral, multilateral
- Power as relation, structure, possession
## Different types of power
### Hard power

**Definition –** Hard power is the ability to influence the others by using force and coercion in order to achieve desired outcomes

**Example –**

- Military action against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq by the US and others (2014)
- Military force against Gaddafi regime in Libya (2011)

### Military power

**Definition –** Military power is military resources (land/air/sea) used to force another state comply or change their behavior

- The most powerful - largest armies, most advanced weapons, the technology and willingness to use the power  
- Measured in the number of soldiers, money spent on defence, the amount spent as a % of state's GDP  
- The largest defence budget - wealthy countries, four of the UN P5
- Poor, unstable countries (Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan) spend a large % of their GDP on defence
- Used for humanitarian objectives to prevent human suffering in the aftermath of natural disasters

**Military most powerful countries in 2022 –**

 1. United States (0.0453)
 2. Russia (0.0501)
 3. China (0.0511)
 4. India (0.0979)
 5. Japan (0.1195)
 6. South Korea (0.1261)
 7. France (0.1283)

**Importance –**

- *Increasing*
	- To be able to be independent, defend themselves from outside attacks, not be vulnerable.
		- War in Ukraine & Russia
	- Deterrence of an attack from another country
		- North Korea's nuclear weapons program
	- Protects civilians under the doctrine of R2P
		- Human Intervention in Lybia
	- Intra-state war is increasing, more global security threats from civil war and insurgencies
- *Decreasing*
	- There is a rise of military alliances
		- NATO
	- While using military power, there is no glory anymore 
		- US invasion of Iraq in 2001 
	- States prefer to improve socio-economic situation of their people
		- Costa Rica – resources on other priorities such as education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability
	- Military power and war has economical consequences
		- US invasion of Iraq 
	- Military power doesn't work against non-state actors and armed groups
		- War on Terror – the Taliban and other non-state actors have remained resilient and continue to carry out attacks against the Afghan government and coalition forces

#### Responsibility to Protect (R2P)

**Definition –** Responsibility to protect (R2P) is a doctrine that states that states can use military and interfere in other countries that abuse human rights

**Example –** Human Intervention in Lybia

- It needs to have the approval of UN Security Council (but veto, ex: Russia, China). 
- First time used was in Kosovo in 1999
- Not used in Syria because of Russian veto.
 
### Economic power

**Definition –** Economic power is when a country has a lot of importance because it can produce, buy, and sell a lot of products or services

Economic power can also be easily measured by multiple indexes

- **GDP** - size of domestic output
- **GDP per capita** - size of the economy as a proportion of the total population
- **economic growth percentage** - annual percentage by which a state's economy has grown

The link between economic power and military power is straightforward : if you have economic power, then you can spend more money in military and therefore increase military power

**Example –**

- Nuclear Deal Negotiations for Iran's Nuclear Program: (2015)

### Soft power

**Definition –** Ability to influence the others by using attraction (diplomacy, norms, values, culture) in order to achieve desired outcomes

**Challenges to soft power –**

- Consistency and patience needed – time-consuming process (can take years to create)
- May be lost in an instant – photographs of US soldiers mistreating prisoners in Abu Gharaib prison in Iraq (2003) became synonymous with a military campaign that many consider illegitimate and illegal
- Cultures and values are embedded in society, thus outside of government's control  
- States may communicate different messages to different audiences (something that persuades in one city may not in the other)

**Example –**

- US state aid agency (USAID) (2015):
- China's infrastructure investments in Africa:

### Smart power

**Definition –** Force and persuasion are used to achieve the desired outcomes

**Example –**

- The nuclear deal between Iran and P5+1: (2015)
- Hezbollah

### Unilateralism

**Definition –** Unilateralism is a policy determined by the interests and objectives of a single state

**Example –**

- War in Iraq
### Multilateralism

**Definition –** Multilateralism is a policy of acting in concert with other states or international organisations

**Example –**

- Paris Agreements

### Structural power

**Definition –** Structural power is the ability to shape the frameworks or structures within which global actors relate to one another

**Example –**

- Human Intervention in Lybia

### Relational power

**Definition –** Relational power is the ability to use relations with another state in order to influence their behavious and achieve desired outcomes

**Example –**

- Threats and rewards (sticks and carrots) - likely to encourage the state to reach the desired goal
	- Iran Nuclear Deal
		- It involved the United States and other countries offering economic incentives to Iran in exchange for limitations on its nuclear program and the threat of reimposing economic sanctions if Iran did not comply with the terms of the agreement.
- Controlling the agenda - limiting the choices of the other state to reach goals
	- US withdrawal from the Paris Agreements
		- The U.S. used its influence to set the terms of the agreement and later exercised its power to unilaterally withdraw from it, thereby shaping the international agenda on climate change.
- Establishing preferences - getting the other state to want the same goal as you
	- Establishment of the World Trade Organization (1995)
		- The U.S. played a major role in setting the terms of the agreement and shaping global trade policies in line with its own preferences.

### Power as possession

**National power :**

- Military strength
- Economic development
- Population
- Geography

## Distribution of power
**Definition –** World Order is the distribution of power between and among states and other key actors

### Bipolarity

**Definition –** Bipolarity is when there are two equal power states that rule the world. There are always tensions, most of the time, they engage in a strategy of deterrence (For example, Mutualy Assured Destruction (MAD)).

**Example –** USSR vs USA during the Cold War

### Unipolarity

**Definition –** Unipolarity is when there is one dominant state that dominates the other states by power. Most of the time, the other states don't want this state to be hegemonic and therefore form alliances. 

**Example –** 90's, 2000's after USSR collapse

### Multipolarity

**Definition –** Multipolarity is whene there are multiple states that have almost equal power as each other, and no state is hegemonic.

**Example –** BRICS and Tiger Economies (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore)

### How is peace and stability more likely to happen

- Unipolarity
	- **Hegemonic Stability Theory –** The absolute power dominance of the hegemon makes conflicts less likely
		- Possibility of unilateral action
		- Balancing coalitions
- Bipolarity
	- **Mutually Assured Destruction** – both sides have the capability to cause catastrophic damage to each other, leading to the understanding that any act of aggression could result in the total annihilation of both nations
		- Proxy War – War in Yemen
			- Saudi-led coalition, composed of Arab states, receives support from UAE, Egypt, and Jordan.
			- Houthi rebels receive support, including military equipment and training, from Iran.
			- Conflict in Yemen serves as a proxy battleground for regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
			- External actors prolong and intensify the conflict through military assistance, financial support, and political backing.
		- Extend or consolidate the control over its sphere of influence

## Power transition & diffusion

**Definition –** Race from the bottom refers to a competitive situation where a company, state, or nation attempts to undercut the competition's prices by sacrificing quality standards or worker safety (often defying regulation), or reducing labour costs.

### Power transition

**Definition –** Power transition is the shift of power from one dominant state or group of states to another, usually through a combination of economic, political, and military factors

**Example –** The rise of China as an economic and military superpower, which has challenged the dominant position of the United States as the sole superpower in the world

### Power diffusion

**Definition –** Power diffusion the process through which power becomes more widely distributed across various actors, such as states, non-state actors, and individuals

**Example –** Multinational corporations like Amazon and Google have a massive global reach and can impact policy decisions, while NGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have been influential in advocating for human rights and promoting democracy around the world
