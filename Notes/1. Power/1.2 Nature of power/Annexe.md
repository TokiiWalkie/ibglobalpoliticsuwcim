**Security dilema** : when the increase in one state's security (such as increasing its military strength) leads other states to fear for their own security (because they do not know if the security-increasing state intends to use its growing military for offensive purposes). It is a *realist* concept.
[Security dilemma - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_dilemma)

- Conflict over territory
- Conflict over ressources
	- 11 billions barrels of oil
	- 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
	- 10% of the world's fishery ressources
	- 30% of the global maritime trade

China (legitimacy based on historical claims → nine-dash line) vs Phillipines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei

→ UNCLOS : UN Convention on the law of the sea → Exclusive Economic Zone (ZEE)
→ 2016 : The Permanent Court of Arbitration of the Hague ruled in flavour of the Phillipines (vs China), but China ignored the ruling of the International Court and maintained its claims.

**Regional dimension** :

- ASEAN : not all countries within ASEAN would like to upset China (ex: Cambodia and Laos) dut to economic relations
  → Lack of uniformity and conscensus among members
- China prefers individual settle the issue individually with every states → able to use relational power and coerce de states

**International dimension** :

- Involvement of the USA (freedom of navigation act) → US protection towards the Phillipines
