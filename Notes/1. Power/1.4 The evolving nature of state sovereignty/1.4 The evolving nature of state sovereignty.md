# 1.4 The evolving nature of state sovereignty

There are different points of views on sovereignty. **Realists see sovereignty as absolute**, this is Westphalian sovereignty. On the other hand, **Liberals see sovereignty as challenged and pooled**, this is responsible sovereignty.

**Definition –**  Sovereignty is the ability of state to exercise supreme control over what happens inside its borders

**Definition –** Internal sovereignty is the ability of a state to exert legitimate control over its population and manage affairs independently

**Definition –** External sovereignty is the ability of a state to get recognised as independent and sovereign by other states, enter diplomatic relations with other states and its external borders are respected

## The Westphalia conception of state sovereignty
### Description of sovereignty

**Definition –** Westphalian sovereignty is the principle of international law that each nation-state has sovereignty over its own territory and domestic affairs, to the exclusion of all external powers. 
It comes from the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) that has put in practice ideas such as diplomacy and non-intervention 

In Westphalian sovereignty, states that can rule itself without intervention of other states.

- States are formally equals
- Sovereignty is internally and externally embeded
- States are the primary actors

**Sources of sovereignty –**

- Recognition by other states due to economic, political and historical considerations
	- Taiwan's recognition by a small number of countries as a sovereign entity despite its territorial dispute with mainland China can be attributed to economic, political, and historical considerations.
- International law and norms
	- Montevideo convention (1933)
- Consent of the governed through political participations
	- Kosovo's decleared independence from Serbia in 2008, following a process of political participation that included a referendum and a parliamentary vote

**Challenges to sovereignty –**

- Decreased significance of borders
	- The Schengen Agreement in the EU
	- Issues that cross borders (climate change, migration, global terrorism)
- Borders still define limits of sovereignty of states and borderless world is an exaggeration


- Economic globalization
	- Joining trade agreements (Trans-Pacific Partnership, EU)
	- MNCs can force states to change their economic policies in return for investment
		- **Glencore in Zambia**
- Taxes, quotas and trade partnerships are still decided by states
- Economic crises require the intervention of states


- Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs)
	- They have supranational power (can create laws and enforce them on member states)
		- **European Union**
	- Collective action to shared challenges of member states
- States choose to join and govern IGOs, and many IGOs allow unequal power to different 


- International conventions
	- 'Responsibility to Protect' is conditional on states behaving responsibly in order to keep sovereignty → Responsible sovereignty
	- External interventions (unilateral or through IGOs)
		- [[Human Intervention in Lybia]]
- States decide to sign and ratify international conventions

	
- Non-state actors (terrorist groups)
	- Attempting to define new borders 
		- **ISIS** ^df2827
- Although states are merely one actor amongst many on the world stage, they remain the most important actor. States exercise power in a way and to an extent that no other actor can
### Recognition of statehood

**Definition –** Statehood is the status of being a recognised independent nation

Statehood can be recognised either at international level, by the United Nations or the International Court of Justice, or at national level by referendum. 

*Constitutive theory of statehood* : A theory that states are only states because they are recognised as such by others.

- Criticisim : The idea of **one state decifing upon another state** in international law is at odds with the fundamental principle of sovereign equality of states.
- Criticism : It is **not easy to break free from a powerful country** that has allies with other powerful countries (Kosovo and Serbia)
- Criticism : **States that face the same problem won't recognise** in the fear that they also will face this problem (Kosovo and China)

*Declarative theory of statehood (Montevideo Convention, 1933)* : A theory that states are only states because they meet 4 criteria :

- Defined territory
	- *Problem : Disputed territories* (for example, border between Serbia and Kosovo), control of territory by non-states actors (for example, ISIS)
- Permanent population
	- *Problem : Refugees* (for example, refugees coming from Syria and Iraq in Europe after the beginning of the civil war)
- Effective government
	- *Problem : Fragile states* (for example, Somalia)
- Capacity to enter into relations with other states
	- *Problem : European Union has become increasingly significant actor in global politics, with partnerships with other states*
- Criticism : There are many challenges to this method because non-state actors conform to some features of statehood and at the same time, in some sovereign states, some of these features may be contested. 

**Example –** International Recognition of Kosovo

**Example –** International recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia
### The responsible conception of state sovereignty

- If a state does not act responsibly i.e violate human rights, other states have the right to intervene and uphold those rights. 
- This is a liberal way of thinking about sovereignty. 
- International conventions no longer regard sovereignty as absolute. State sovereignty is conditional on states behaving responsibly.

- **Challenges to sovereignty –**
	- Terrorist groups
	- IGOs
	- International conventions (humanitarian intervention)
	- Economic globalisation

## Nation state and stateless nation

### Nation state

**Definition –** A nation-state represents a synthesis of state and nation, where the majority of its inhabitants are part of a single nation.

**Features of a nation –** 

- **Shared Culture:** Encompassing language, traditions, celebrations, and often religion.
- **Common History:** Members are connected through historical events, narratives, and shared ancestors.
-  **Self-identification:** Individuals see themselves as part of the nation, often feeling a deep sense of belonging.

### Stateless nation

**Definition –** A stateless nation identifies a nation that doesn’t possess its own sovereign state territory. It may span across multiple states, often advocating for more autonomy or complete independence.

**Features of a stateless nation –**

- **No Sovereign Territory:** Their homeland stretches across the boundaries of other states.
- **Distinct Identity:** Despite lacking sovereignty, it preserves a distinct culture, language, and traditions.
- **Independence Movements:** Many stateless nations champion recognition, autonomy, or their own sovereign state.
