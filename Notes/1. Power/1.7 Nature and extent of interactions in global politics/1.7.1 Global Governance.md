# 1.7.1 Global Governance

**Definition –** Global governance is the way states organise themselves, make agreements and tackle shared challenges above national level, usually through international organisations with clear rules

**Perspectives –**

- Liberal – Global governance is a priority as it allows state to react and solve problems they have in common
- Realist – International organisations are frequently unable to agree as state project their national interests

**Difficulties –**

- Multipolarity and institutional gridlock
	- On climate change, powerful countries such as the United States, China, and Russia have competing interests and priorities, challenging to come to a consensus
- Harder problems and lack of consensus
	- Some countries may prioritize economic growth over environmental concerns, while others may prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions even at the cost of economic development

**Alternative to –**

- International anarchy – according to Realists it is the central feature of the international system marked by absence of a supranational authority capable of regulating the behavior of states. States are thus sovereign entities, forced to rely on self-help for survival and security. 
- Global hegemony – international order imposed ‘from above’ by a hegemonic power that possesses pre-eminent military, economic and ideological resources and so is able to impose its will worldwide (a global hegemon).
- World government – idea of all of humankind united under one common political authority.

**Examples –**

*really, not the most relevant examples*
