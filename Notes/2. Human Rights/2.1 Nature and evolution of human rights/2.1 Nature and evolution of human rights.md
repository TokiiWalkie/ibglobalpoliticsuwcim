# 2.1 Nature and evolution of human rights
## Definition of human rights

**Definition –** Rights are
	- Rectitude (Understanding when something is good/right)
	- Entitlement → belief or expectation on treatment that we think we have

**Definition –** Positive rights are rights that need an authority to be fulfilled
**Definition –** Negative rights are rights that do not need authorities to be fulfilled (can change and become positive if there are not necessary circumstances)

**Definition –** Human rights are the indivisible rights which all human beings are entitled to by virtue of their humanity, without discrimination

- Human rights are made to fulfill human needs
- The moral nature of human rights is to live a dignified life (which is a social construction)
- **universal** -  inherent to human beings and not dependent on other aspects of identity such as nationality, location, age, gender, faith, colour, religion or language
- **interdependent** - successful protection of some of these rights protects the others
- **indivisible** - all human rights are of equal importance and cannot be arranged into a hierarchy
- **inalienable** - they cannot be taken away from (or given away by) human beings, and all human beings are entitled to the full package of rights.

**Definition –** Justice is the belief in the concept of 'fair treatment', which supports the idea that people getting what they deserve. Justice is a codification, a systematic organisation of norms and laws.

**Retributive justice –**
- Believes in the deserving of a punishment for a wrong thing, must be proportional and appropriate
- Is made to protect against any abuse of human rights
- Works for a single act or an act that implies a collectivity, such as a genocide or war crimes, but requires systems and institutions that must own legitimacy

**Distributive justice –**
- Resources and chances should be equally distributed

**Definition –** Rule of law is the principle that law should ‘rule’, in the sense that it establishes a framework within which all conduct and behaviour takes place. 

That is, all individuals are considered the same and laws must be accessible, clear and enforced in fair trials. This is fundamental in a democratic system

**Theory of Justice –**

- Theorised in 1971 by John Rawls
- Sees justice as a 'fair treatment' that is a fair distribution of resources and opportunities within a society
- In a hypothetical scenario, individuals will gather to decide principals of justice in their 'original position' under a 'veil of ignorance'

**Definition –** Law are considered objective rights that must be respected

## The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights

- The UNDHR is not a law, but a set of principles and moral ideals to defend (but also defines human dignity)
- The UNDHR has limitations
- In 1966 was released the International Bill of Human Rights which is legally binding
	- First, liberty – International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
	- Second, equality – International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights
