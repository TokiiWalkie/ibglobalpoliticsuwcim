# 2.2 Codification, protection and monitoring of human rights
## Human rights laws and treaties

- **Definition –** International law is a norm, defined by a legislative authority (a parliament), and which is compulsory, has a coercive nature, and is public
	- Public law – relation between states and international organisations
		- Customary law – practice
	- Treaties – can be bilateral or multilateral, and must be signed and ratified by countries
- International law has no legislative authority to create laws
- International law also has no world police
- States obey because it is in their interests to obey the law because
	- States do not want to be isolated
	- States believe in international values
	- → Utilitarian compliance

- **Limitations of international law –**
	- There is no effective system to enforce international law
		- [[Case Study - Child Labour in Nepal]]
	- Countries can decide to ratify a treaty or not
		- Less possibilities to monitor and denounce human rights

- **Differences between the Covenants and the UDHR –**
	- The UDHR is a set of principle while the covenants are international laws thus binding
	- The UDHR is directed towards individuals whereas the convenants are directed towards states to protect specific rights
	- The convenants create a system of monitoring
	- The covenants expand the scope of second generation rights (social and economic rights)

## Protection and enforcement of human rights at different levels

- **Regional level –**
	- At a regional level, the covenants are more enforced because of the presence of an authority that can enforce them.
	- European Convention on Human Rights 1950 (1953)
	- African Charter on Human and People's Rights (1981)
