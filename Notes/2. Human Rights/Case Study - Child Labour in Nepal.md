# Case Study – Child Labour in Nepal
## Notes

Over 1 million children engaged in labour
Law prohibits employment under 14
10% of brick factories employ underaged children
Can go as young as 5 years old
1.75$ per day
No proper training, poor working conditions → frequent injuries
17000 children working in brick factories, even in some that were subsidised by development agencies
1/7 children in Nepal engaged in labour of any kind
Pledged to eradicate child labour by 2025
10 inspectors, 30 million inhabitants
→ Cycle of poverty
1/5 children from 5 to 12 estimated to be out of school
Many people do not realise that child labour is illegal, and don't think it is harmful, because it has been generationally rooted
