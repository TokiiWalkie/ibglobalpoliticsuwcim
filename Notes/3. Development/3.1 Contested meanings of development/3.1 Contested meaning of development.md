# 3.1 Contested meaning of development
## Different definitions of development

**Case studies –**

- China: Economic growth vs. well-being
- Bhutan: Gross national happiness and well-being
- South Korea: 

**Definition –** Development is a sustained increase in the standards of living in a society

Conventionally, development was simply used in the context of economic growth or perceptible and quantifiable economic and technological advancement (Orthodox View of Development)

Nevertheless, social and political factors, like human rights and democracy are equally important in development

- For development to occur, it is important that economic growth also translates into an improved quality of life for people in every area of society, bringing in a human dimension to its understanding
- Similarly, it also has to be sustainable – that is, endure for future generations

**Maslow’s hierarchy of needs –**

![[Pasted image 20230929111607.png]]

- Maslow's hierarchy of needs can be critiqued as being an 'ethnocentric' Western theory
- Geert Hofstede (1984) argued that Maslow’s thesis may well fit socially and culturally ‘individualist’ societies in the West, but less so the more collectivist societies of the eastern hemisphere or the Global South
- Maslow’s ‘self-actualisation’, in Hofstede’s view, is an individualist concern and not the highest level need in all societies: ‘In more collectivist cultures, “belongingness” may have to come above ego-needs like self-actualization and esteem’
### Development as economic growth

The aim of economic development is to increase productivity and revenue, to establish new industries; innovate and diversify the economy into many different sectors

**Definition –** Poverty is the lack of resources to meet basic needs 

**Poverty as a multidimensional condition of human life –**

- *Social dimension* – lack of power, lack of education, lack of entitlements, lack of opportunities, lack of social networks, exclusion, dependency
- *Material dimension* – lack of economic resources, housing, nutrition, possibility of movements
- *Psychological dimension* – depression, lack of trust for the future, insecurities
- *Cultural dimension* – shame, lack of respect
---
- *Absolute poverty* – when one earns less than $2.15 per day
- *Relative poverty* – when one earns less than the national poverty line
---
- Multidimensional Poverty Index is the best indicator to measure poverty
- Freedom can be either positive or negative.
- Development cannot occur if there is no reduction of poverty and a more equitable distribution of wealth
---
- From 1990 to 2015, the proportion of the global population living in extreme poverty has decreased from 36% to 10% (World Bank, 2018)
- Poverty is as much about restricted opportunities and the absence of freedom, in particular positive freedom, as it is about lack of income or resources

**Demography influences development –**

- Urban/rural
- Overpopulation
- Gender/ethnicity
- Age

**Scales of development –**

- Individual
- Community
- National
- Regional
- Global
### Human development

**Human development is multidimensional –**

**Definition –** Human development is a standard of human well-being that takes account of people’s ability to develop their full potential and lead fulfilled and creative lives in accordance with their needs and interests

- Living a long and healthy life 
	- life expectancy at birth
- Acquiring knowledge
	- Adult literary rate
	- Gross enrollment ratio
- Access resources for decent standard of living
	- GDP per capita
- Can be calculated by the Human Development Index (HDI)

 **Prerequisites people require to pursue a life of value –** 

- Widening people’s choices through formation of human capabilities – through improved knowledge, skills and health
- The level of their achieved well-being and the use people make of these capabilities – for leisure, productive purposes or being active in political/social/cultural affairs

**An increase in a country’s GDP does not translate to an improvement in its inhabitants’ standard of living –**

- The poor may not be able to enjoy the benefits of this increase in income due to income disparities
- Weak governance, absence of a government inclined to assist the poor
- High levels of corruption

**Conditions needed to create human development**

- Building and improving human capabilities through ensuring good nutrition, education and sharpening skills
- Making sure that these honed skills and improved human capital are used to acquire better employment or participate actively in political decision-making and so forth
### Sustainable development

**Definition –** Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs

- It contains two key concepts: the concept of **need**, and the concept of **limitations**
- Stresses the need to balance the three interlinked areas – social, economic and environmental
- Foster social and economic development while ensuring environmental protection for future generations
	- resources are finite and have to be used with caution and care
- Stress the need to eliminate poverty, alter consumption patterns and protect natural resources in the process of economic and social development

**Reformist sustainability vs strong ecology –**

*Reformist sustainability –*

- accepts that economic growth is desirable, but recognizes that growth must be limited to ensure that ecological costs do not threaten its long-term sustainability
- human capital can be substituted for natural capital
- **the key requirement of sustainability is that the net sum of natural and human capital available to future generations should not be less than that available to present generations**

*Strong ecology –*

- rejects the pro-growth implications of reformist sustainability
- need to preserve and sustain natural capital, seeing human capital as little more than a blight on nature

**Aspects of sustainable development –**

- Social development
	- Fundamental needs must be met equally for all
	- The pursuit of a higher standard if living should not harm/exploit others
	- Promotes equality, education and participation in local communities to address these needs
- Economic development
	- Improvements in standard of loving requires the generation of wealth through economic activity
	- Sustainable economies have to be competitive in the world market
- Environmental protection
	- There are limited resources ana a need for clean water, air and land, and adequate food
	- Sustainable activities seek to protect the environment for the future and curb problems, such as global warming and deforestation

**Critical objectives sustainable development (identified by the World Commission on environment and Development) –** 

- Revival of growth
- Changing the quality of growth
- Meeting important needs for jobs, food, energy, water and sanitation
- Ensuring sustainable level of population
- Conserving and enhancing resource base
- Reorienting technology and managing risk
- Merging environment and economics in decision-making

**Necessary conditions for sustainable development –**

- Political system
	- secures effective citizen participation in decision-making
- Economic system
	- provides for solution of tension arising for disharmonious development
- Production system
	- respects obligation to preserve ecological base for development
- Technological system
	- fosters sustainable patterns of trade and finance
- International system
	- fosters sustainable patters of trade and finance
- Administrative system
	- flexible and capacity for self-correction
## Measuring development
### Income-based measures

**Development can be seen as economic growth and can be measured using two indicators –**

- GDP – Gross Domestic Product - total economic value of goods and services produced in a country in a year
- GNP (or GNI) – Gross National Product - total economic values of goods and services produced by the residents of a specific country regardless of the place of production 
- GDP per capita – low, middle, high income countries

**Inequalities can be measured using Gini coefficient - how wealth is distributed –**

- Ranges from 0 to 1 – quantitative way of talking about poverty
	- 0 – most equal country
	- 1 – most inequal country

- Inequalities are linked to human rights and social movements
	- Because inequalities enable human rights abuses
	- Because the people will fight for equality through social movements

**Criticism of income-based indicators –**

Does not consider how the wealth is distributed among the population. This can be very misleading in unequal societies (i.e if the rich are getting richer, this may show an increase in GDP per capita, even though the situation of the poor did not change at all)

### Human Development Index (HDI)

**Aspects of Human Development Index –**

1. Life expectancy at birth
2. Average years of schooling of people 25 years old and above, expected years of schooling of a child
3. PPP GNI per capita

**HDI reveals –**

- National priorities in terms of which countries are effectively combining economic progress with social development. The rankings also reflect on which sector – education, health or income – has been successfully built on or is lagging behind
- Potential growth – if a country has built up human capital, and the correct policies are employed, it is very likely that people will have access to market opportunities, resulting in equitable economic growth
- Disparities between people – the report has breakdowns of data on the basis of gender, income, geographical region and ethnicity

**Criticism of Human Development Index –**

- HDI assigns weights to certain factors that are equal tradeoffs when these measurements may not always be equally valuable
	- For example, countries could achieve the same HDI through different combinations of life expectancy and GNI per capita. This would imply that a person's life expectancy has an economic value
- HDI correlates factors that are more common in developed economies
	- For example, a higher level of education would tend to lead to higher GNI per capita. Critics argue the benefit or lack thereof of including two highly correlated values when perhaps one would be a better indicator of a country's well-being
- The HDI also fails to take into account factors such as inequality, poverty, and gender disparity

### Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) - sustainable development

The Genuine Progress Indicator uses a set of 26 indicators including social, environmental and economic factors which are used to measure the quality of life. 

Beginning with GDP, the GPI also factors in all the intangible and unaccounted positives such as parenting, volunteer work and higher education and then lessens the costs of social and environmental setbacks (i.e deforestation, pollution)

### Happy Planet Index (HPI)

Measures the extent to which countries are able to provide a happy, long and suitable life for their citizens and inhabitants

Countries are ranked on the basis of how many happy and long lives are produced for every unit of environmental output

Reveals that most of the high-income countries ranked low on the index due to their use of the environment

**Indicators used by the HPI –** 

1. Life expectancy
2. Experienced well-being (where respondents can rank their lived on a scale of 0 to 10);
3. Ecological footprint (a per capita measure of the amount of land needed to sustain the consumption patterns of a country
