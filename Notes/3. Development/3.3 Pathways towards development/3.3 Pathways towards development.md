# 3.3 Pathways towards development

## Models of development
### Historical perspective

- Discussions on development became important in 1945 because the world needs to be reconstructed after WWII and the process of decolonisation is ongoing
- The first-world wonders how should they relate to these newly independent countries
- Two main ideologies fight each other at the end of WWII, the Capitalist world led by the USA, and the Communist block led by the USSR, we enter a situation of bipolarity
	- Truman intended to build liberal institutions
	- 1944 – Bretton Woods conference in the US – foundation of the contemporary financial system
	- 44 industrialised countries create institutions in order to foster liberalism
		- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
			- How to foster free-trade, how to deregulate the market
		- General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade → World Trade Organisation (1955)
			- Give advices on how to develop a correct financial system
		- World Bank

### Modernisation theory –

- Most famous thinker: Rostow
- Capitalist society, based on rationality
- The point of development is the possibility for the mass of the population to consume more and more products
- Became hegemonic after WWII
- For Rostow the state still has to invest and develop fiscal policies 
- Influence expanded in the 1970s and 1980s through the rise of neoliberalism and the conversion of the institutions of global economic governance and a growing number of states, to pro-market economic philosophy, and again in the 1990s through the widespread introduction of market reforms by former communist states

**Five stages of development –**

![[Pasted image 20230929085152.png]]

- Developed countries must be at least at the stage of take-off
- Traditional societies – such societies are characterized by rudimentary technology, pre-scientific values and norms, and a subsistence economy. 
- Preconditions for take-off – at this stage societies exhibit a degree of capital mobilization (banks and currency) and start to develop an entrepreneurial class. 
- Take-off – this happens when the norms of economic growth are well established and sector-led growth becomes common. 
- Drive to maturity – this is characterized by growing economic diversification, greatly reduced poverty and rising living standards.
- High mass consumption – at this stage, the economy is increasingly orientated around the production of modern consumer goods, with affluence becoming widespread
### Dependency theory

- Challenges Modernisation theory
- Developed by Gunter Frank
- The idea of development by the West cannot be followed by other countries because West development is based on exploitation
- First used by Latin America but then was expanded to the whole non-Western world
- The solution is to break the ties with the Northern countries in order to focus to produce goods locally, to import substitution policies and to overvalue currency

**The development of underdevelopment –**

- Core areas that are characterized by relatively high wages, advanced technology, and a diversified production mix, including mass-market industries and sophisticated agriculture. 
- Semi-peripheral areas that are economically mixed, including some core features and some peripheral ones.
- Peripheral areas that are characterized by low wages, more rudimentary technology, and a simple production mix geared towards staple goods such as grain, wood, sugar, and so on.
### Neoliberalism

- The neoliberal model of development that emerged during the 1970s endorsed the belief that for the well-being of people and the economic growth and development of a country it was best for the state to minimize its intervention and leave the market free to function on its own, setting wages and prices.
- Argues that government interference almost always has negative long-term consequences on development. This is because it can create sudden economic growth that does not last, and because corrupt officials have a lot of opportunities to take money for themselves illegally. 
- Development should grow from FDI rather than government investment. Furthermore, the amount the state spends on public services such as healthcare and pensions should be smaller, so that people are encouraged to work and contribute to the economy

**Historical perspective –**

- In the 80's, a debt crisis by the Southern state happened, which borrowed large amounts of money in the 60's and 70's to Northern government, multilateral agencies and private banks (the money came from oil money)
- Structural adjustment program – Set of policies the World Bank, the IMF and the US government set aiming the Southern countries, constraining them to follow them in order to keep receiving aid
	- Privatisation of state firms - allows for competition, reduces drains on state resources if firms are doing badly
	- Removal of state subsidies - foster competition
	- Improvements in tax system - to increase state income
	- Removal of wage control
	- Reduction of government workforce
- The cost of structural adjustment policy were hard on human welfare
	- Real wages went down and poverty increased
	- Unemployment increased
	- Cost of living arose
	- Removal of state safety net led the most vulnerable and destitute with no safety net

**Main principles of neoliberalism –**

- State's interference is questioned
- Free market
- Open competition
- Limited state intervention
- Individual self interest
- Deregulation
- Privatisation of state enterprise
- Foreign direct investment

**Consequences of neoliberalism –**

- lead to healthy competition, meaning that only the strongest companies survive and grow, which in turn leads to sustainable long-term growth and development
### Washington Consensus

**Definition –** set of economic policy recommendations for developing countries, and Latin America in particular, that became popular during the 1980s. The term Washington Consensus usually refers to the level of agreement between the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and U.S. Department of the Treasury on those policy recommendations

- In the 1990s, a lighter version of the neoliberalism ideology emerged, often referred to as the Washington Consensus
- Stronger emphasis on free market non-interventionism, strong institutions and good policies. 
- Tries to find a balance between complete deregulation and a strong and accountable government that manage the negative effects of liberalization
- Pro-democracy argues that free markets can only function effectively and efficiently in an environment where the rule of law is respected and citizens are able to express their opinions. 
- The Washington Consensus attempts to balance deregulation with an accountable government who oversees the market
## Case Study – India's farmers

- One of the biggest protest in the world
- Lasted for months
- New law was to be passed
- For a long time farming has relied on subsidies
- Half of Indian population works in agriculture
- Only 1/6 of gdp, issues about ownership, corruption
- Cannot agree on how to make the change
- Minimum prices assured by mandis, but farmers can now sell directly to markets
- Afraid that deregulation of culture, the prices will go down and so will their wages
- Law was rushed in the parliament without much discussion
- Protesting camps settled in India, where people rotate to protest
- Government is censoring internet around the camps
- Police violence, and democracy in India are questioned

- Laws have been forced to introduced in the shadow of the lockdown, the opposition could not argue
- All the parties have at some point tried to pass these laws
- Decrease of the public investment in rural areas
