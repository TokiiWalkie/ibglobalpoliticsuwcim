# 3.4 Debates surrounding development
## Globalisation

**Definition –** The increasing interdependence among countries, regions and people due to the integration of trade, culture, finance, people and ideas in one global marketplace.

**Advantages of globalisation –**

- Increased economic growth
	- economies that have access to more markets, workers and resources are more likely to grow. This can mean more wealth for more people
- Improved standards of living
	- workers who work within growing economies have more purchasing power and can access a wider variety of ideas, products and services
- More democracy
	- economies that become more financially open usually have to become more politically open. Greater freedoms are enjoyed by people living in politically open states
- Cultural development
	- globalized cultures tend to embrace modern ideas, for example, with regards to women’s rights, children’s rights, worker rights and the rights of other minority groups (i.e LGBTQ and racial minorities)
- Transnational problems
	- (i.e environmental pollution, climate change, threat of terrorism), all of which impede the goal of sustainable human development, can be managed and handled more effectively

**Disadvantages of globalisation –**

- Loss of jobs
	- for people in countries with high cost of living as factories and manufacturing units are shifted to underdeveloped countries
	- greater employment in underdeveloped countries, but high change of exploitation of local labour
- Growing wealth gap
	- in a globalized marketplace, wealth can become concentrated within an elite.
- Wage competition
	- workers have to compete with workers in other countries and this places pressure on wages. This result is potentially lower wages, as multinational corporations can threaten to relocate their factories to places with lower worker wages. While this may be good for corporate profits, it is bad for worker
- Price competition
	- there is global price competition, meaning prices are sometimes lowered. However, the option to buy abroad is usually only of benefit to large corporations and not individuals
- Regulation avoidance
	- corporations locate factories in countries where regulations are less strict. Regulations might cover workers’ rights, health and safety, or child labour
- Lack of cultural diversity
	- globalization does not always lead to an equal exchange of ideas, products and services
	- English is becoming a dominant language. At the same time, Western corporations are dominant within marketplaces, while non-Western corporations go bankrupt, finding it difficult to compete.

**Critique of economic globalisation –**

1. The winner succeed on the expense of the losers (i.e. The North exploits the Global South)
	- TNCs contribute to this process by exploiting raw materials and cheap labour in the South and by expatriating profit to the North
1. Between-country inequalities are exacerbated by the tendencies implicit in the global trading system
	- Free-trade favours the interest of rich states as it gives them access access to the markets of poorer states without exposing themselves to their vulnerabilities
2. Growing rural poverty
	- Caused by the conditions of the loans granted by international financial institutions, encouraging peasant farmers to convert to cash crops, produced for export, and abandon subsistence farming geared to local needs and local communities
3. Globalisation has fostered in-countries inequalities
	- Strengthening social hierarchies
		- Corporate power has gained a lot of power because of a lack of regulation, which allow them to exert more power in the decision-making process (ex: ability to relocate investment and production almost at will)
		- Trade unions have been weakened by the fear that agitation for higher wages or improved conditions will merely threaten job security
	- the emergence of a more open and competitive economy has forced all states, to deregulate their economies while also rolling back welfare and redistributive programmes
		- **critique of the 'trickle-down economy'**

**Advantages of economic globalisation –**

1. Surest way of narrowing down inequalities, and reducing poverty
	- Globalisation is a positive-sum game
		- mutual benefits flow from engaging in the global economy
		- globalization has levelled the competitive playing field between advanced industrial and emerging economies
	- Example – 
		- newly industrialised countries have based their development on a strategic engagement with the global economy rather than any attempt to opt out of it. (China, Tioger Economies)
		- Countries that are out of globalisation have low growth rate and still struggle with extreme poverty (Sub-Saharian African countries)
2. TNCs bring a range of benefits, including employment opportunities, better wages, training and investment in skills, and modern technology
3. Pro-globalization theorists tend to argue that if within-country inequality grows as the rich get richer, the important thing is not that the poor keep up but that they become less poor
## Inequalities
### Role of the state

States are central to addressing developmental inequalities, because they hold a lot of power. They can enact and enforce policies that can either mitigate or exacerbate these disparities.

**Economic policies and redistribution –**

- Progressive taxation and social security systems are fundamental tools states can use to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality
- Investment in public goods, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, directly impacts the quality of life and can help in lifting populations out of poverty → human development

**Regulatory frameworks –**

- Enforcing strict regulatory frameworks on business practices, environmental conservation, and labour laws can check the exploitative tendencies of MNCs → role of the state in enforcing human rights
- Introducing minimum wage laws, mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR), and strict environmental regulations can lead to more equitable development

**Challenges faced by states  –**

- Political instability, corruption, and limited resources can hinder the effective implementation of policies aimed at reducing inequality
- States often grapple with the challenge of attracting foreign investment while simultaneously upholding high regulatory standards, which can sometimes lead to a 'race to the bottom' in terms of labour and environmental standards

### Role of IGOs

**Promoting equity and development –**

- The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a pivotal framework many IGOs align with to tackle global inequality.
- Financial and technical assistance from organisations like the World Bank and IMF are crucial for developing countries, although the conditions attached to these aids and loans often spark debate.

**Limitations and critiques –**

- The influence of powerful member states in IGOs can lead to policies that prioritise their interests over the needs of the less developed nations.
- Critics argue that programmes like SAPs often lead to cuts in essential public services, exacerbating poverty and inequality in the name of economic stabilisation.

### Role of NGOs

**Grassroots movements and advocacy –**

- NGOs often work directly with marginalised communities, giving them a platform to voice their concerns and demands.
- They play a crucial role in influencing public opinion and policy-making, advocating for human rights, environmental protection, and social justice.

**Accountability and transparency –**

- NGOs monitor and report on both state and corporate activities, holding them accountable for their impacts on society and the environment.
- Transparency International, for example, plays a critical role in highlighting issues of corruption that directly affect development and inequality.

**Challenges and limitations –**

- NGOs sometimes face accusations of being too Western-centric or not adequately understanding local contexts and needs.
- Operational challenges, including funding dependence, bureaucratic hurdles, and political opposition, can impede their effectiveness and reach. 

### Role of MNCs

**Contributions to Economic Growth –**

- By creating jobs, paying taxes, and bringing investment, MNCs can contribute significantly to national economies.
- Their global reach and resources enable them to introduce innovative technologies and business practices in developing markets.

**Critiques of MNC Practices –**

- There are numerous instances where MNCs have been implicated in human rights abuses, unfair labour practices, and environmental damage in pursuit of profit.
- The issue of profit repatriation and tax avoidance by MNCs results in significant capital flight from developing countries, undermining their economic development.

**Regulating MNCs –**

- National and international efforts to regulate MNCs include corporate taxation policies, anti-trust laws, and international agreements on labour and environmental standards.
- Initiatives like the United Nations Global Compact aim to encourage sustainable and socially responsible policies among businesses.

### Financial Flows and Development Inequality

**Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Aid –**
- While FDI can bring in much-needed capital, technology, and expertise, it needs careful regulation to ensure benefits are widely distributed and sustainable.
- Aid, both bilateral and multilateral, is crucial for development projects but can sometimes be tied to the political and economic interests of donor countries, influencing domestic policies in recipient countries.

**Tax Evasion and Illicit Financial Flows**

- Developing countries lose huge sums every year due to tax evasion by both local elites and foreign corporations.
- Global efforts to curb tax evasion, such as the OECD's Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, are critical in ensuring fair taxation.

**The Role of International Cooperation**

- Addressing issues like tax evasion, unequal trade practices, and harmful financial speculation require coordinated international action.
- Global agreements and cooperation, such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on money laundering, are vital in managing these challenges.

## Sustainable development

### Development impacts environmental factors

- Climate change
	- Anthropocene
- Resources
	- Example – Norway, a country full of natural resources and highly developed
	- Example – Venezuela, a country full of natural resources and poorly developed
	- Example – Singapore, a country with no resources and highly developed
### Environmental factors impact development

- Geography
	- Terrain
		- **Example –** Nepal
	- Climate
		- **Example –** Sahel
- Resources
