It's not merely a post-conflict reactive strategy but a proactive measure to prevent the outbreak or recurrence of violence.
- **Reconciliation:** Entails rebuilding damaged relationships and fostering a sense of trust and cooperation among former adversaries. It's a societal process that involves mutual acknowledgment of past suffering, the changing of destructive attitudes and behaviours, and building shared visions of an inclusive and harmonious community.
