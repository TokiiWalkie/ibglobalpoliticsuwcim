# IB Global Politics HL Passdown

Hello dear firsties :).

I am sharing with you a clean version of my Global Politics HL notes as a passdown. It covers all four units, and has some other resources that are very useful to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of global politics :). It does not contain many case studies, I had to delete them as the text did not belong to me hence I am not allowed to share it, however the title of the example and the case study is still there, you can find a lot of informations online, and I am sure that some of my dear co-years will be willing to share stuff with you as well :).

For more resources, I recommend you to use the undergraduate textbook 'Global Politics Third Edition' by Andrew Heywood and Ben Whitham, you can download it here for free: https://annas-archive.org/md5/2813bdd3ee5aa4bfd9d20a7dfaa3a9d8

Good luck for your year 1 exams and for your second year, don't stress, many cool things lie ahead! ðŸ«¶ðŸ«¶
