As a discipline, the humanities incorporates many other disciplines, like philosophy, history, religion, art, and more. However, when it comes to analyzing, the humanities has a strong link to philosophy. This means there is a big focus on the actual arguments and ideas when analyzing a subject. Picking apart the arguments to truly understand what they are saying is often at the heart of analysis in the humanities.

The humanities has also come to be more and more concerned with justice and equity. The different fields of the humanities place a great emphasis on understanding the topic from different views, or paradigms. A paradigm is basically a specific perspective or view from which we might understand a topic. So a paradigm is like a pair of glasses that we look through when we want to understand a topic. When we look at a topic from different perspectives, it might help us see the situation from different angles and understand different aspects of the issue.

For example, if we wanted to understand the impact of certain religious rituals on the life of a religious person, we would get a very different perspective between a person who is religious from a person who is not. The goal of analysis in the humanities is to consider both sides, allowing us to have a more holistic understanding of the impact of that kind of experience or event.

#### **Tips**

There are many different ways to approach analyzing topics in the humanities. The approach you use will usually depend on the kinds of information you are looking at and what you want to get out of it. The page [**Humanities Research Strategies** (University of South Carolina)](https://libguides.usc.edu/c.php?g=480121&p=3282675) will give you a bit of an explanation of some of the different approaches you could take to analyzing subjects in humanities.

### **Truth?**

A big question in the humanities, and especially philosophy, is “What is truth?” or even “How do we know we have the truth?” Analyzing in the humanities doesn’t just rely on demonstrating research and facts. It also means looking at how that information is interpreted. That means looking at explanations and arguments and analyzing those. So analysis in the humanities often asks questions like the following:

- What is the argument here?
- What are the justifications given in this argument for reaching that conclusion?
- Do these justifications make sense?
- How is this information being collected? Is it reliable?
- Do the arguments lead logically from one to the next?
- Is there a particular perspective or bias in the arguments?

In the humanities it isn’t enough to look at just the research data or facts being presented. You also need to analyze the bigger picture and ask ask whether or not the arguments themselves make sense.

### **Paradigms and Perspectives**

The humanities is a discipline that generally focuses on the study of human culture. However, there are many different cultures out there. And different cultures create different perspectives, or even different paradigms. A paradigm is generally defined as a particular perspective or way of viewing the world. Different cultures around the world have different perspectives on many issues. So when we analyze something in the humanities we try to understand how those different perspectives, or paradigms, might impact how we understand the topic.

One of the most important aspects of analysis in the humanities is understanding that issues can and should be viewed from many different perspectives. Our analysis then needs to take those different perspectives into consideration. That doesn’t mean that you have to analyze a given topics from all kinds of different perspectives. It just means that you need to be a bit more aware of the perspective you are using when you do analyze the topic. Depending on the perspective you use, you might notice certain aspects over other aspects, as you might give more priority to those topics. This isn’t necessarily wrong, as long as your conclusions keep this fact in mind.
